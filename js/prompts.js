1. For performance data:
   - Calculate the average grade for each homework assignment.
   - Identify any homework where the average grade is significantly lower than others (for example, if the second homework shows a notably lower average, recommend reviewing its content).
   - Highlight any trends, strengths, or areas for improvement.

2. For attendance records:
   - Identify students with irregular attendance patterns, such as those who have missed three or more consecutive classes.
   - Provide recommendations on addressing these attendance issues.

Please format your analysis in clear markdown with sections like "Observations" and "Recommendations".
